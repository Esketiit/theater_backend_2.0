# README

This is the repo for Theater's Rails/Postgres backend. If you are looking for the React frontend, [click here](https://github.com/Esketiit/theater_frontend "It wont bite") 

Theater is a project that I whipped up in two weeks for my graduation from Flatiron Academy! It's a platform for people to create, share and view playlists of videos quickly and easily. Theater is still a work in progress, so expect some changes and bugs to pop up as time goes on (help or tips of any kind are very much appeciated). 

 * To get things up and running(Theater's backend must be started before the frontend):
    * Make sure Postgres is installed and running
    * Clone this repo to your machine
    * Navigate to the theater_backend directory
    * Run the following commands: 'rails db:start', 'rails db:migrate', 'rails s'

#### To-Do's
- [ ] Implement live chat and video streaming in rooms /(websockets)
- [ ] Make creating playlists and adding videos less cumbersome 
- [ ] Add more options for social interactions /(friends lists, favorite rooms, profile customization)
- [ ] Make it look nice
- [ ] Host on a server and show off to some friends!
